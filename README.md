# Login_system
I am currently practicing the implementation of a login system using Node.js and Passport.js. Passport.js is a middleware for Node.js that simplifies the process of implementing authentication strategies, including username and password authentication. By using Passport.js, I aim to create a secure and efficient login system for my application, ensuring that user credentials are protected and authenticated before accessing the application's features.
